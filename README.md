# RedShift User Manual

In order to use RedShift, you must first launch RedShiftServer.java on the computer that you wish to host the server on. To do this, make sure that the program is compiled by running "javac RedShiftServer.java" as well as "jar xf json-simple-1.1.jar", then launch the server by running "java RedShiftServer". The server reads a config file, config.json, when booting up. This file contains several options for the server, such as port and password. When the server is ready, launch the client application by running "python3 RedShift.py \<IP\> \<PORT\>". Any number of clients may connect to the server. The client will display a GUI that manages your interaction with the server. When you first connect, you will either be prompted for a username or the server password. Simply type the information in the text box at the bottom and click submit or hit enter. When you have finally joined the channel, you will see messages from every user that is connected. To get a list of commands that you can use, type /help and hit the submit button. When you are finished, close out the GUI to terminate the program. To stop the server, you must press Ctrl+C in the terminal that it is currently running in. There is a master server running at www.sanguinary.org on the port 25565 with the password "guest". This server is hosted on an AWS EC2 instance that is up 24/7.
